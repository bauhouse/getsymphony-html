            <description mode="formatted"><p>Symphony doesn&#8217;t tell you what kind of content to manage, or how. It doesn&#8217;t lock you into a rigid structure or dictate some silly URL schema. It just <em>gives you the tools</em> and stays out of your way. Trust us, you&#8217;ll like it.</p></description>

            <description mode="formatted"><p>Stop learning proprietary languages and memorizing template tags. Symphony leverages <em>open standards</em> like XML and XSLT, and good old XHTML and CSS. Even the admin interface employs the widely-used jQuery library, so extension developers don&#8217;t have to learn a whole new framework when extending the back end.</p></description>

Swiss Army knives are nice, but a surgeon wouldn&#8217;t operate with one. With Symphony, you <em>craft exactly the tool you need</em>.</p></description>

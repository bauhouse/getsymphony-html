            <conclusion mode="formatted"><p>Congratulations, you've just installed Symphony! Before you jump out of your chair for a celebratory dance, we've got a little cleaning up to do:</p>
<ol><li>First, delete the (<code>/install</code>) folder. If you used an FTP client to upload your files, just select the file and delete it. If you used the command line, `cd` to the root of your Symphony installation and do: <code>rm install.php</code>.</li>
<li>Second, be sure to tighten up the folder permissions you adjusted in Step 3. Exact settings will depend on your server environment, but the permissions on your root directory and your <code>symphony/</code> directory should be fairly restrictive (try something like 755). Then set <code>manifest/</code> and <code>workspace/</code> to 775 (make the <code>workspace/</code> permissions recursive, so they apply to its subdirectories as well).
<pre><code>chmod 755 symphony .
chmod -R 775 manifest
chmod -R 775 workspace</code></pre></li>
</ol><p><em>Now</em> you can dance (try not to embarrass yourself too badly). When you're finished, log into your Symphony <a>admin interface</a> (<code>http://yourdomain.com/symphony</code>) and look around. The real fun is about to begin...</p>

            <introduction mode="formatted"><p>Installing Symphony is a fairly simple and straightforward process. This tutorial will walk you through the options available during installation and show you how to get the system up and running in no time.</p>
<p>The first thing we'll do is make sure your server's got everything it needs to run Symphony smoothly. Then we'll talk about the two available installation methods—package-based and Git-based—and outline the benefits of each. Once you've chosen a method, we'll show you how to get Symphony onto your server, and we'll finish preparing for the installation by creating a database. Finally we'll run the install script, do a little cleanup, and point you toward a few additional resources.</p>
<p>Ready?</p></introduction>

            <description mode="formatted"><p>Now that you've decided on an installation method, let's get Symphony uploaded to your server. Follow the set of instructions that corresponds to the installation method you've chosen. The first two are for performing a package-based install—one for those who'd like to use an FTP client, and one for those who'd like to use the command line. The third set is for those who've opted to perform a Git-based install. </p>
<h5>Using a .Zip Package and FTP</h5>
<ol>
<li>Grab the current release package from <a href="/download/releases/current">http://getsymphony.com/download/releases/current</a> and save it to a local directory.</li>
<li>Extract the package.</li>
<li>Using your favorite FTP client, connect to your server and upload the contents of the extracted directory to the desired location on your server. Note that you <em>don't</em> want to upload the directory itself (the one named <code>symphony-n.n.n</code> where <code>n.n.n</code> is the version number), only its contents. In other words, you want Symphony's <code>index.php</code> right in the directory where you're installing Symphony.</li>
<li><em>Optional</em>. If you'd like to start with a completely clean system (rather than starting with the default <a rel="concept">workspace</a>), you can delete the <code>workspace/</code> directory.</li>
<li>Use your FTP client to <em>temporarily</em> set permissions on the root directory (the one you just installed to) and the <code>symphony/</code> directory to <code>777</code> (read, write, and execute for all). Then set permissions on the <code>workspace/</code> directory to <code>777</code> and tell your client to apply the changes recursively (to all subfolders). <strong>NOTE: We'll undo this step and tighten up permissions after installing</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Using a .Zip Package and Command Line</h5>
<ol>
<li>SSH into the directory where you'd like to install Symphony (usually the server's web root).</li>
<li>Execute one of the following commands, depending on whether your server supports <code>wget</code> or <code>curl</code>:
<pre><code>wget http://symphony-cms.com/download/releases/current &amp;&amp; unzip symphony-n.n.n.zip &amp;&amp; rm symphony-n.n.n.zip &amp;&amp; mv symphony-n.n.n/* . &amp;&amp; rmdir symphony-n.n.n</code></pre>
(If you use the <code>wget</code> command, be sure to replace <code>n.n.n</code> with the version number of your download.)
<pre><code>curl -L http://symphony-cms.com/download/releases/current > symphony.zip &amp;&amp; unzip symphony.zip &amp;&amp; rm symphony.zip &amp;&amp; mv symphony-n.n.n/* . &amp;&amp; rmdir symphony-n.n.n</code></pre></li>
<li><em>Optional</em>. If you'd like to start with a completely clean system (rather than starting with the default <a rel="concept">workspace</a>), you can delete the <code>workspace/</code> directory:
<pre><code>rm -R workspace</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Set <em>temporary</em> permissions for the install script:
<pre><code>chmod 777 symphony .
chmod -R 777 workspace</code></pre>
<strong>NOTE: We'll undo this step and tighten up permissions after installing</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Using Git</h5>
<ol>
<li>SSH into the <em>parent directory</em> of the directory where you'd like to install Symphony (for example, if you're installing into your server's root at <code>public/html</code>, you want to SSH into <code>public</code>).</li>
<li>If the directory you want to install into exists, make sure you've safely backed up its contents and emptied it. Then remove the directory (in the example above, you'd execute the command <code>rmdir html</code>).</li>
<li>Clone the Symphony Git repository using the following command:
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2.git directory</code></pre>
(Be sure to replace <code>directory</code> with the name of the directory where you'd like to install Symphony. For example, is you're installing to your server's web root at <code>public/html</code>, you'll want to use <code>html</code>).</li>
<li>Enter the new directory, and install the default extensions:
<pre><code>git submodule update --init</code></pre>
or, if that doesn't work:
<pre><code>git submodule init
git submodule update</code></pre>
</li>
<li><em>Optional</em>. If you'd like to include the default <a rel="concept">workspace</a> (rather than starting with a completely clean system):
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/symphonycms/workspace.git</code></pre></li>
<li>Set <em>temporary</em> permissions for the install script:
<pre><code>chmod 777 symphony .
chmod -R 777 workspace</code></pre>
<strong>NOTE: We'll undo this step and tighten up permissions after installing</strong>.</li>

            <conclusion mode="formatted"><p>Congratulations, you've just installed Symphony! Before you jump out of your chair for a celebratory dance, we've got a little cleaning up to do:</p>
<ol><li>First, delete the (<code>/install</code>) folder. If you used an FTP client to upload your files, just select the file and delete it. If you used the command line, `cd` to the root of your Symphony installation and do: <code>rm install.php</code>.</li>
<li>Second, be sure to tighten up the folder permissions you adjusted in Step 3. Exact settings will depend on your server environment, but the permissions on your root directory and your <code>symphony/</code> directory should be fairly restrictive (try something like 755). Then set <code>manifest/</code> and <code>workspace/</code> to 775 (make the <code>workspace/</code> permissions recursive, so they apply to its subdirectories as well).
<pre><code>chmod 755 symphony .
chmod -R 775 manifest
chmod -R 775 workspace</code></pre></li>
</ol><p><em>Now</em> you can dance (try not to embarrass yourself too badly). When you're finished, log into your Symphony <a>admin interface</a> (<code>http://yourdomain.com/symphony</code>) and look around. The real fun is about to begin...</p>

            <introduction mode="formatted"><p>Installing Symphony is a fairly simple and straightforward process. This tutorial will walk you through the options available during installation and show you how to get the system up and running in no time.</p>
<p>The first thing we'll do is make sure your server's got everything it needs to run Symphony smoothly. Then we'll talk about the two available installation methods—package-based and Git-based—and outline the benefits of each. Once you've chosen a method, we'll show you how to get Symphony onto your server, and we'll finish preparing for the installation by creating a database. Finally we'll run the install script, do a little cleanup, and point you toward a few additional resources.</p>
<p>Ready?</p></introduction>

            <description mode="formatted"><p>When installing Symphony, you can choose one of two methods: upload the contents of a <code>.zip</code> package to your server, or clone the Symphony Git repository directly. There are pros and cons to each method.</p>
<h5>Package-based Install</h5>
<p>If you've installed other web-based software before, this is probably a method you're used to. You simply upload the contents of the Symphony package to your server using either an FTP client or the command line. The benefits of this method are that it's usually easier for beginners and doesn't introduce any additional server requirements. Unfortunately it also means you'll have to repeat the process whenever you update Symphony. </p>
<h5>Git-based Install</h5>
<p>Git is a popular version control system that is used to manage Symphony's codebase. Using Git to install Symphony only takes a few commands, and has the added benefit of keeping your installation linked to the official repository (which makes updating Symphony a breeze). To use this method, though, your server must have Git enabled and you need access to the command line (usually via SSH).</p>
<p>If you're comfortable with Git, using it to install Symphony can really pay off in the long-run. But if in doubt, just go ahead with a package-based installation.</p></description>

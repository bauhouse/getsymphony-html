<p>Upgrading is generally quite simple, but your particular approach depends on how you installed Symphony, and what youâ€™ve done with it since. </p></introduction>

            <description mode="formatted"><h4>Package-based upgrade</h4>
<p>The package-based upgrade is just like the package-based <a href="http://getsymphony.com/learn/tutorials/view/install-symphony/2/">installation</a>, except you'll need to avoid overwriting your customizations. Let's begin by <a href="http://getsymphony.com/download/">downloading the current release</a>, and be sure to have an FTP client handy. When you're ready to go, login to your Symphony website as an administrator.</p>
<p>Now extract the new release's zip package and overwrite your site's <code>symphony</code> folder by uploading the new <code>symphony</code> folder. Do the same for <code>update.php</code> and <code>index.php</code>. Can't find <code>update.php</code>? Congratulations, you must be updating to the 2.3 branch of Symphony, which means you'll need to overwrite <code>index.php</code> and bring in the <code>install</code> folder. Last, you will need to overwrite Symphony's core extensions with the new versions, but don't overwrite the whole <code>extensions</code> folder, since you probably have some custom extensions you want to keep.</p>
<p>You may also overwrite any custom extensions with new versions, which is optional unless the Symphony upgrade breaks compatibility with the extension(s) you're running. </p>
<h4>Git-based upgrade</h4>
<p>Using Git can make the upgrade process completely painless! In the most basic scenario, you can simply SSH into your site's host, and issue the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>cd /path/to/your/site
git pull
</code></pre>
<p>this will update the Symphony core files for you automatically. Follow this up with:</p>
<pre><code>git submodule update
</code></pre>
<p>and you should be ready to go. </p>
<h5>Handling conflicts</h5>
<p>It's common to get stuck with conflicts, due to deviations between your site's files and those in the Symphony repository. If you run into a submodule error during the <code>git pull</code> step, you'll need to stash your changes:</p>
<pre><code>git stash
git pull origin master
git stash apply
</code></pre>
<p>Note that you may have to individually resolve conflicts with <code>git add</code> or <code>git rm</code> during the <code>git stash apply</code> step.</p></description>

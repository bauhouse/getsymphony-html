            <introduction mode="formatted"><p>Your site might be humming along just fine, but nobody likes an outdated Symphony (excepting Beethoven fans.) For the best security and stability, you need to be running the newest release available. </p>
<p>Upgrading is generally quite simple, but your particular approach depends on how you installed Symphony, and what youâ€™ve done with it since. </p></introduction>

            <description mode="formatted"><p>Before you do anything potentially destructive to your site, make a full backup of all files, as well as your Symphony database. Be sure not to miss the <code>.htaccess</code> file in your site's root directory.</p>
<p>It's also a good idea to understand the differences between versions. Check the current release's details to see what's fixed, and verify how many versions behind your site is. Ensure that any of your critical extensions have been updated for compatibility with the new release, by checking the glorious <a href="http://symphonyextensions.com/matrix/">extensions compatibility table</a>. (If you're still not sure, just <a href="http://getsymphony.com/discuss/">ask in the forum</a> and someone will help you out.)</p>
<p>If possible, we strongly recommend that you test your upgrade on a development instance of your site, instead of jumping straight into a production upgrade.</p></description>

                <answer mode="formatted"><p>A key principle in Symphony&#8217;s <a href="/learn/articles/view/the-tao-of-symphony/">development philosophy</a> is simplicity. We leave all non-essential functions out of the core system, allowing them to be re-integrated as extensions. This keeps Symphony development agile, makes the system as flexible as possible, and benefits the broadest number of users.</p>
<p>If the feature you&#8217;re looking for can&#8217;t be found in our <a href="/download/extensions/">extensions library</a>, you can find out in the <a href="/discuss/">forum</a> if anyone is working on it. If not, maybe <em>you</em> can build it!</p></answer>

                <answer mode="formatted"><p>Unfortunately not. The database structure, and Symphony&#8217;s XML structure and XSLT implementation, have all undergone significant changes which make these two versions incompatible.</p>
<p>If Symphony 2 offers substantial reasons for you to upgrade, it might be worthwhile creating a new website with S2 and then manually importing your old data with an SQL export. This could take a lot of work, but in future we might be able to offer an importer script to help streamline this process.</p></answer>
